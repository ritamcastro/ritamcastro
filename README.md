## Who am I? 
💜 My name is **Rita Castro**.

👩‍👦 I the **Mother** of one little boy.

💻 I am a **Software Developer** since 2008.


## What do I like? 

🎨 I like to *paint mandalas* and the pots that my *plants* live.

🧱 I also like my *Lego™️* and my collection of *Wonder Woman POPs™️*.

🎮 I am the master of *Kirby🩷* and King Dedede🐧 on SuperSmash Bros.

🚲 My favourite means of transportation is the *bike* - yes, in Lisbon, with its seven hills.


## What do I do? 

🛰️ I used to build standalone applications for mission planning systems and data processing at [Deimos Engenharia](https://elecnor-deimos.com/category/deimos-engenharia/).

🚙 Now I work for [Volkswagen Digital Solutions](https://www.vwds.pt/) in Lisbon, boosting Volkswagen Group’s Digital journey around the world.

🧰 My goal as a Software Developer is to be able to **Build the Right Product** (by it being user driven) **and Building it Right** (by using XP and TDD). 

🪢 I think there is an **Entanglement of Concerns** between People and Software Development that can not be overlooked.
